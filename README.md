# 1.-Study-of-Word-Embedding-in-Supervised-and-Unsupervised-Tasks

NLP based feature learning technique, Word
Embeddings maps words into vectors of real numbers that
capture the context of the underlying words in relation to
other words in the sentence. This conversion outcomes in
words that can be depicted as a vector in an n-dimensional
vector space and the distance between two such vectors
depict the level of resemblance between these words. The
recent considerable progress in the quantity of easily
accessible Quora text has got to the foreground the necessity
for large-scale natural language processing tools for text
mining. In this project, a study of several word embeddings
including Word2Vec, FastText, Glove, SBERT, and
Doc2Vec is conducted for supervised and unsupervised
tasks on Quora dataset. Supervised task is to identify
duplicate questions in the dataset through binary
classification, while unsupervised task is clustering Quora
questions.
